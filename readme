SUPPORT ZINT
------------

The Zint project is committed to providing the open source community with encoding software for
all public domain barcode standards. For this we need access to the standard documentation and,
unfortunately, this is not free. Your donation will contribute towards the purchase of standard documents
from ANSI. Standards which we hope to add to Zint in this way include Aztec Mesas, Code 49, 
Supercode, Code One. If you have a preference regarding
which standard you would like your donation to go towards then please let us know and we will reserve your
donation for that standard.
